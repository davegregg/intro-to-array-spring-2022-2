# Intro to Arrays

## Rule #1 of Notetaking
  - Most of your notes should be in your words/drawings.
## Rule #2 of Notetaking
  - The first note you take about a new concept should relate that concept with others which you already know. Focus on *connections*, not precision. Also connect the new concept with the big picture (why, when).

# Vertical: Big Picture Context
- Holds more than one variable.
- We might think of variables as normally holding only one thing at a time. But arrays allow us to store multiple items together and assign that list to a single variable.
- Keeps data organized.
- Works very well with loops.
- Like traffic, there is a sense of *direction* to arrays. Arrays can go one way or they can go both ways.
